\item A matrix with n elements can be represented as a matrix of order $\brak{r\times c}$ if and only if n,r and c are all natural numbers(Here r is the number of rows and c is the number of coloumns in the matrix.).This is possible only if r is a divisor of n.

\newline
\item So the total possible orders a matrix with n elements can have is equal to the total number of divisors of n.

The following python code finds the total possible orders (d) for a matrix of n elements.
