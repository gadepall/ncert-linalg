\item Find the area of a parallelogram whose adjacent sides are given by the vectors 
	$\myvec{3\\1\\4}$ and $\myvec{1\\-1\\1}$\\
	The following python code computes the area of required parallelogram.
	\begin{lstlisting}
	./codes/quadrilateral/q3.py
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\solution The area is given as
	\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{2}\norm{\myvec{3\\1\\4}\times\myvec{1\\-1\\1}}
	\end{align}
	which is calculated and found as 3.24
\end{enumerate}
