In right triangle ABC, right angled at C, M is
the mid-point of hypotenuse AB. C is joined to
M and produced to a point D such that DM =
CM. Point D is joined to point B. Show that

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
\item $\triangle  AMC  \cong   \triangle  BMD $
\item $\triangle DBC $ is a right angle.
\item $\triangle  DBC  \cong  \triangle  ABC $
\item $CM = \frac{1}{2} AB$
\end{enumerate}
