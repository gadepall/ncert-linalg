$\triangle AMC$ and $\triangle DMB$ are congruent to each other by SAS congruency.
\newline
(i) Side AM  is equal to the corresponding side BM  [As M is midpoint of AB]
\newline
(ii)Side CM of is equal to corresponding side DM [As M is midpoint of DC]
\newline
(iii)$\angle AMC$ = $\angle DMB$ [ Vertically Opposite Angles]
\\
Hence, proved
