Work done in moving an object by a distance \textbf{s} using an external force \textbf{F} is given by:
\begin{align}
W = \vec{F^T}\vec{s}
\end{align}
As seen above, work done is the scalar product (dot product) of Force and distance.  Here, 
\begin{align}
\vec{s}=\myvec{0\\0\\4}   
\end{align}
The scalar product of the variables is given by:
\begin{align}
\vec{F^T}\vec{s} = \myvec{1 & -2 & 3} \myvec{0\\0\\4} = 12
\end{align}
The work done by the force \textbf{F} is 12 J
