The total books in the bookshop can be expressed as 
\begin{align}
    \vec{A} = 12 \myvec{10 \\ 8 \\ 10}

    \vec{B} = \myvec{80 \\ 60 \\ 40}.
\end{align}
The total amount received by the bookshop after selling the books is given by,
\begin{align}
    \vec{A}^{\top}\vec{B} = 12 \myvec{10 & 8 & 10}\myvec{80 \\ 60 \\ 40}
    =20160
