%In right triangle ABC, right angled at C, M is
%the mid-point of hypotenuse AB. C is joined to
%M and produced to a point D such that DM =
%CM. Point D is joined to point B. Show that

Verify that the median of a triangle $\triangle ABC $
with vertices A = (4  -6$)^{T}$, B = (3  -2$)^{T}$, C = (5  2$)^{T}$ divides it into two triangles of equal areas.
%\begin{align}
%A = (4 -6), B = (3 -2), C = (5 2) 
%\vec{A} &= \myvec{4\\-6} \vec{B} &= \myvec{3\\-2} \vec{C} &= \myvec{5\\2} 
%\end{align}
